## Task 1
The `processArray` function in `arrayManipulation.js` takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each even number is squared, and each odd number is multiplied by 3.

## Task 2
The `formatArrayStrings` function in `arrayManipulation.js` takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers. It returns a new array of strings where each string is converted to uppercase if the corresponding number in the numbers array is even, or converted to lowercase if the corresponding number is odd.

## Task 3
The `createUserProfiles` function in `userInfo.js` takes two arrays as input: an array of names and an array of modified names. It creates an array of user profile objects, where each object contains the original name, the modified name, and an ID (based on the index of the name in the input arrays).

If the two input arrays have different lengths, the function throws an error.

## Task 4
This task involves updating the README.md file with the student ID and a brief explanation of each task, as shown above.
